# Scala Class Instantiation Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with classes in Scala: attempting to instantiate a class and call its method directly without using the `new` keyword.  This results in a compilation error because the class name is interpreted as a value or variable rather than a class constructor.

The `bug.scala` file shows the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.scala` file provides the corrected version.
